# Indian-Actors-Database
Database of Indian Actors - Assignment- Intern

The database was created by scraping throught the top 100 indian actors list on IMDB website.
The scraped categories include site url, name, image url and trademark personality(if available).

The actors images file contains the .jpeg images of all the actors.
But for proper database management i have stored the image URL in the actors_database.csv database file. 
This enables the user to perform modifications and customizations according to use case, rather than having a column of image paths.

This database can be used to perform functions such as,
1. source for website creation.
2. source of datasets for various image based predictive models.
3. Classification models.
4. and any other user-case based functionalities.
